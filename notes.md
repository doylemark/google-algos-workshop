# How to attack a novel problem

1. Understand the problem fully. Clarify any questions
2. Solve the problem manually
3. Optimize the manual steps
4. Write the manual steps as comments to pseudo-code
5. Replace the comments/pseudo-code with real code
6. Step through this with your sample data to validate the logic
7. Look for pitfalls: Race conditions, Edge cases etc.
8. Optimize the real code

### Clarifying the problem

Manufacture or otherwise obtain some examples of the problem - not just one, a range of examples
that illustrate different logical paths or results (later, these are unit tests).

Work through these and verify your understanding.

If you just don't understand the problem at all, ask for examples to be provided to you.
